To use the Azure Cognitive Services Python SDK for making predictions with your Custom Vision model and to securely store your secret keys in Azure Key Vault, you need to follow these steps:

1. **Install the SDKs**:

    You'll need to install the Azure Cognitive Services Custom Vision and Azure Key Vault SDKs. You can install them using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install azure-cognitiveservices-vision-customvision
    pip install azure-keyvault-secrets
    pip install azure-identity
    ```

2. **Authentication with Azure Key Vault**:

    To access secrets stored in Azure Key Vault, you need to authenticate using the `DefaultAzureCredential` which can handle authentication for you based on your environment. Ensure you have set up your Azure account and permissions correctly for Key Vault.

    ```python
    from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
    from azure.keyvault.secrets import SecretClient

    key_vault_url = "<Your-Key-Vault-URL>"
    credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
    client = SecretClient(vault_url=key_vault_url, credential=credential)
    
    prediction_key = client.get_secret("custom-vision-prediction-key").value
    endpoint = client.get_secret("custom-vision-endpoint").value
    ```

    Replace `"<Your-Key-Vault-URL>"` with your Key Vault's URL. The `"custom-vision-prediction-key"` and `"custom-vision-endpoint"` are the names of the secrets where you stored your prediction key and endpoint URL.

3. **Using the Custom Vision Prediction SDK**:

    With the prediction key and endpoint retrieved from Key Vault, you can now use the Custom Vision Prediction SDK to make predictions:

    ```python
    from azure.cognitiveservices.vision.customvision.prediction import CustomVisionPredictionClient
    from msrest.authentication import ApiKeyCredentials

    # Replace these with your Custom Vision project details
    project_id = "your_project_id"
    publish_iteration_name = "your_iteration_name"

    # Authenticate to the Custom Vision service
    credentials = ApiKeyCredentials(in_headers={"Prediction-key": prediction_key})
    predictor = CustomVisionPredictionClient(endpoint, credentials)

    # Replace 'path_to_your_image' with the local path to an image file
    with open("path_to_your_image", "rb") as image_contents:
        results = predictor.classify_image(
            project_id, publish_iteration_name, image_contents.read())

    # Display the results
    for prediction in results.predictions:
        print("\t" + prediction.tag_name + ": {0:.2f}%".format(prediction.probability * 100))
    ```

    Replace `"your_project_id"` and `"your_iteration_name"` with your Custom Vision project's ID and the name of the iteration you want to use for predictions. Also, replace `"path_to_your_image"` with the path to the image you want to analyze.

These steps cover setting up the environment, retrieving your keys securely, and making a prediction using the Custom Vision Prediction SDK in Python. Make sure your environment is correctly configured for Azure, and you have the necessary permissions for Azure Key Vault.
